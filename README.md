# c-challenges
Contains my compilation of basic, intermediate, and advanced C challenges

The challenges are collected from various sources, including but not limited to coding learning platforms, open websites, in-lecture challenges, academic worksheets, aspects of real-life projects, self-formulated challenges inspired by conversions with people, real-life problems, and random imaginations, among others. 

The collection of challenges is not exhaustive. Rather, it is an ongoing process with not definite time as to when the last challenge will be added to the repository.

## Grouping
The challenges are grouped into Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. The grouping is based on my perception of the relative ease of individual solutions, not general programmers' perception. Therefore, what has been categorised as advanced in this repository may be intermediate to someone else.

## Questions and Solutions Order
The order in which challenges questions are listed in the Wiki (https://github.com/DavidOfili/c-challenges/wiki) corresponds with the order that solutions are presented in the respective code files.
